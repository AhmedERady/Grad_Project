By default, an image of a Corn suffering from common rust
ailment is hardcoded as an input to the system in the main.py.

In order to change the input open the src folder inside the
Func_Sim folder and then open main.py with a text editor.

Note line numbers 7,8 where string variables called 
image_folder & image_name are initialized.

These variables' values should be replaced with the required
folder & image pair.

The eval folder that is located inside the Func_Sim folder
contains all the evaluation image folders and image names

Inside the eval folder lies the 12 disease classes that our
model can infer.

Inside each class lies 3 images for evaluation that the model
was never introduced to during training.

Replace the the values of the image_folder & image_name 
variables with the selected class name & image name pair,
as shown in the default Corn Common Rust example.

Always remeber to add the .type (png/jpg/ect) at the end.

Save and run the main.py to further evaluate the system on
different classes and inputs.
