Due to this being a pure functional simulation with no 
realistic timing/clock/delay factors, the total time that is
output at the end of runtime is only for optimization purposes.

At the end of each run, the code hangs even after output 
display, this is due to the API, System, FPGA threads never 
returning. This is done in order to simulate on demand nature. 
Ctrl+C should exit safely.
