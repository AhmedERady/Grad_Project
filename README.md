# Info
Not only does this project review the intricate fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks, but it also accomplishes an applicational implementation of plant disease detection on a DE10 FPGA via the use of a fully custom MobileNet V1 implementation on raw Python libraries.

With the aid of more than 30+ papers reviewed - An exploration into the practical methods used to attempt such an implementation was a heavy priority for a feasible implementation plan.
